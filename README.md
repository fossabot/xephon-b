## FAQ

Q: How can I get involved?
A: Thanks for your interest, but this project is still in very early stage,
the best we can provide you for now is the [reading list](doc/reading.md) and [awesome list](https://github.com/xephonhq/awesome-time-series-database),
which can provide you some insight on both usage and internals.

Q: Is this benchmark suite for time series database only?
A: Yes, its load is quite different from both RDMS and NoSQL store. That's why we create a new tool.

Q: Why Xephon-B?
A: B is for benchmark and Xephon comes from the animation [RahXephon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RahXephon).
